* Input is a list of id<MKAnnotation>
* Refresh mechanism as user scrolls or programmatically
* Output is clustered annotations. Each indexPath.section is it's own "layer"
* Annotations must animate nicely for add and remove


* Add delegate/reloadData type mechanism for annotations. EX:
-(void)mapView annotationForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)indexPath

* This way each section can be an independent layer (and have it's own tree)



********* Optional (nice to have)
* Ability to uncluster (use as normal map view)
* Ability to animate between clustered and unclustered
* Have a couple of nice built in animations
* Let subclasser override the animations



*************** Debugging
* Print size of quadtree (make sure it's the same after reclustering)
